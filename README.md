# MCHG

### An alternative Minecraft Hunger Games Plugin.

This code follows roughly the design documents put together by Endain, Strudel and Xobar. Documentation of the plugin use and plugin design will be available to a selective group hosted via google docs. If you would like access to these documents please contact Endain <endain.gaming@gmail.com>.

* Plugin Overview: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D5hpQ_aDzGCGyUAsW4-ZPhkurBiR_FADhNFVugIlFNg/edit
    * This document details some of the general requirements and features of the plugin. It list API's to be used, what items to stock chests with, etc.
* Game Flowchart: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1653X1cV0stpt4GaqIeV8JA9oZTHsY1sRyAUyGWgOLoE/edit
    * This diagram shows how the game progresses through its states and defines what sequencees of event may happen.
* Class Structure: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1hJWh31vr2wFCynBgafP-FhPyNMf32jpPu4g_jX3NPbo/edit
    * This is a **WIP** diagram that will eventually show the generalized relationship between classes, no UML here, just loose association to give a general idea.
* Data table Design: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgGQNZc_nyy0dGVWc3phc1ZSLTNxTG1ZalMtYXYtQUE
